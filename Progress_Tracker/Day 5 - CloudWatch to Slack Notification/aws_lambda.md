## What is AWS Lambda?

- [What is AWS Lambda?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)
- AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers
- Lambda runs your code only when needed and scales automatically
- With Lambda, code can be run for virtually any type of application or backend service
- Lambda runs code on a high-availability compute infrastructure
- It performs all of the administration of the compute resources
  - server maintenance
  - operating system maintenance
  - capacity provisioning
  - automatic scaling
  - code monitoring
  - logging
- Lambda can run in response to events, such as
  - changes to data in an Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket or Amazon DynamoDB table
  - HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway
  - API calls using AWS SDKs
- Lambda can be used to build
  - data processing triggers for AWS Services such as Amazon S3 and DynamoDB
  - process streaming data stored in Amazon Kinesis
  - create own backend that operates at AWS Scale, performance, and security
  - serverless applications composed of functions that are triggered by events
  - etc..
